### ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! My name is Seraphina. I have many nicknames<sup>1</sup>, feel free to call me whatever comes to mind (anything but `Sera`). My pronouns are she/her/they/them.

I am a Software Engineer based in Boston, currently working for [Wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/careers). 


### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about


**Dependency Health:** Check out [deptrics](https://github.com/finn-orsini/deptrics)! 

**Abstract Syntax Trees:** [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) is one of my favorite things on the internet. 

**My Dog:** His name is Huck and he loves long walks on the beach.


### ðŸš« Don't ask me about 

**Side Projects:** I love my engineering job, and I work hard to balance it with the rest of my life. I prefer to spend my free time on other interests. 

**Being A Woman in Tech:** Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not so great. My gender does not define me or my work.
